### Analysis on mice dataset

The aim is to understand which trisomy protein classes that contribute to the success and the failure of mice learning. Analysis is conducted by creating a model which predicts the 8 classes of mice based on their protein expression levels. We can then decide which proteins were significant in the predictions i.e. support a hypothesis where we could say that a particular protein might affect learning in trisomic mice.
