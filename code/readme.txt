Instructions to execute script:-

1. Place the Assignment2.ipynb file in the Scripts folder which is within the Anaconda folder. Please look for the path depending on the location you have stored the Anaconda
   files. In my case, the path was like C:/winuser/Anaconda/Scripts.

2. Open the Anaconda to run the localhost where the kernel would run your Jupyter notebook.

3. The Anaconda window appears, click on the Jupyter. Now a tab will be created on the browser which is a jupyter notebook for running .ipynb files.

4. Click on File then click on Open. Another tab will be displayed which will show all the files within Anaconda directory. Browse for Scripts folder name and then click on it.
   Then again it will now show the list of contents within Script directory. Search for Assignment2.ipynb file and then click on it.

5. Your Jupyter notebook will be displayed in another tab. Now to run all the code of each block at once Click on Kernel and then Click on 'Restart and Run all'. 
   The kernel would then run the code of your jupyter notebook. Wait until the output for each block is displayed. 

6. If you want to manually run each block of code line by line then select that line and then click on Run or Ctrl+Enter. An output will be displayed accordingly.
